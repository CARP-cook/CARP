    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>CARP is a community-powered reward system for carp anglers. Members post pictures of their best catches on our Discord – including the weight in pounds – and receive CARP tokens in return. It's all about fun, sharing, and celebrating impressive fish!</p>

    <h2>How does it work</h2>
    <p>Once you join our <a href="https://discord.gg/uCfASwEcAw" target="_blank"><strong>Discord server</strong></a>, everything is handled by the CARP bot. You get an automatic wallet address and can interact using simple slash commands like <code>/tip</code>, <code>/send</code>, or <code>/redeem</code>. CARPs are distributed based on the weight of the carp you post. These tokens can then be tipped to others, redeemed for special perks, or used in community raffles and events.</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <p><strong>Do I need to install anything?</strong><br/>For CARP, all you need is Discord. The CARP bot handles everything for you. Optionally, you can also check your balance and transactions in the  <a href="https://carpwallet.vecocoin.com" target="_blank"><strong>CARP Web Wallet</strong></a> or the <a href="https://carpexplorer.vecocoin.com" target="_blank"><strong>CARP Explorer</strong></a>. There are several wallets available for Litecoin, e.g. the Litewallet app for mobile phones or Electrum for desktop computers. For VECO you can use the web wallet or install a node on your PC. For more information check out the links below.</p>
    <p><strong>Can I buy CARP?</strong><br/>CARP is not for sale. It’s a utility token you earn by sharing photos of your real carp catches.</p>
    <p><strong>What can I do with my CARPs?</strong><br/>
You can tip other anglers, send CARP to friends, or redeem it for decentralized cryptocurrencies.  
Currently, CARP can be redeemed for <a href="https://litecoin.org" target="_blank"><strong>Litecoin (LTC)</strong></a> (a popular, well-established crypto currency and investment) or  
<a href="https://vecocoin.com" target="_blank"><strong>VECO</strong></a> (an ultra-low-fee coin perfect for micro-transactions).
More features like raffles are coming soon!</p>

    <summary><strong>Disclaimer</strong></summary>
    <p>CARP is a community-based token created for recreational and entertainment purposes. It is awarded exclusively to members of our Discord community for sharing fishing-related images, particularly of their biggest catches. CARP cannot be purchased, sold, or traded on any exchange and holds no monetary value.</p>
    <p>While CARP may optionally be redeemed for small, predefined amounts of cryptocurrency (e.g., VECO or LTC), these redemptions are provided as voluntary, symbolic rewards and do not constitute a financial transaction or promise of future value. The CARP system is not an investment product, and no profits, dividends, or financial returns are associated with CARP ownership.</p>
    <p>Participation in the CARP community is entirely voluntary. By submitting content, you agree to our community guidelines and grant us the right to display submitted images in the public gallery.</p>
    <p>CARP is operated on a best-effort basis. We do not guarantee uptime, reward availability, or service continuity. The project is experimental and non-commercial. Use of CARP and participation in associated services are at your own risk.</p>
